  "RTSP request/response messages — [RFC 2326] §4-§8, §12 — over a
  persistent byte stream.

  RTSP is RFC 2326's *own* profile, not HTTP/1.1 reused wholesale: the
  request/status line and `field-name \":\" field-value` header grammar
  are HTTP-shaped ([H6] is cited throughout), but two framing decisions
  are RTSP-specific and this namespace gets both of them right rather
  than borrowing HTTP's:

  1. **No chunked transfer coding.** §4.3: \"RTSP does not (at present)
     support the HTTP/1.1 'chunked' transfer coding and requires the
     presence of the Content-Length header field.\" A body is exactly
     `Content-Length` bytes, full stop — there is no chunk-size line to
     parse and no trailer to skip.
  2. **Absence of Content-Length means zero, not 'read until the
     connection closes'.** §4.3 rule 2: \"If this header field is not
     present, a value of zero is assumed.\" HTTP/1.0 responses use
     connection-close as an implicit length; RTSP explicitly does not,
     because §4.2 says a message with a payload MUST carry
     Content-Length — closing the connection to delimit a body is not a
     fallback this protocol defines.

  Bytes are `vector<int 0..255>` in and out, the same convention
  `rtp.header` and `modbus.pdu` use. `rtsp.bytes` is the one place the
  octet range is mapped to/from characters for the (ASCII-range)
  start-line and header text; the body is never round-tripped through a
  string at all — it stays exactly the byte slice `Content-Length` says
  it is, so a JPEG or an SDP body with a stray high-bit octet is neither
  interpreted nor mangled by this layer.")

  SP or HTAB — is not a new header, it is more of the previous header's
  value, folded. The fold collapses to a single space, matching what
  `field-value = *( field-content | LWS )` says the *parsed* value is
  (the raw whitespace run's exact width is not semantically part of a
  header value, so preserving it would make two byte-different-but-
